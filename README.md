# TBay Marine Monitor
A marine environment monitoring and logging system using Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) and open source web standards and protocols

# Initial Proposal - Application/Front end

I plan to design and implement a front end application that uses and visualises data from other third party services. My main goal is to utise the platform Blynk, a hardware-agnostic IoT platform with white-label mobile apps, private clouds, device management, data analytics, and machine learning.

My plan is to have my application display data such as local tide times, water temperature, current strength/direction, water depth, as well as a local weather report. This data will be optained from out marine monitor device placed on a bouy in Tramore Bay.
